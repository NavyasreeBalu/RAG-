# Problem Selection Rationale

## Chosen Problem: Problem Statement 2 - Improved RAG Retrieval Strategy

### Why I Selected This Problem

I chose Problem 2 because it addresses a fundamental issue I experience daily when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).

When I use AI assistants, I often receive responses that include irrelevant information or miss the most pertinent details, even when the correct information exists in the knowledge base. This happens because current retrieval systems don't effectively surface the right context before generation.

### Technical Reasoning

While Problem 1 focuses on system integration - connecting various tools and services together - Problem 2 tackles the core challenge of making AI more reliable and accurate. It poked my interest.

### Strategic Impact

I believe improving the foundation - how AI systems find and use relevant information - will have greater long-term impact than building another integration layer. Better retrieval directly addresses:

- **Hallucination reduction**: Ensuring responses are grounded in actual knowledge
- **Relevance improvement**: Finding the most pertinent information for user queries  
- **Enterprise reliability**: Critical for regulated environments where accuracy matters
- **User trust**: Building confidence in AI-generated responses

### Personal Interest

This problem resonates with my experience as an AI user and my curiosity about what makes AI systems actually useful and trustworthy.
